# The_guessing_game
This contains the different alterations of the guessing game to help understand how Python works. The first version (version 0) is the correct code. The other versions are different alterations containing slight changes and depending on what changes, the outcome will change. 
The rules: There is a secret password. You have 3 guesses. If you guess it right within 3 guesses, you win. Otherwise, you lose.
