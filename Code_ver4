#Make a guessing game with limited number of guesses
password = "Blackfire"
guesses = ""
guesses_count = 0
guesses_limit = 3
out_of_guesses = True #Note here we change this boolean value to True instead of False. This code will give us 2 sets of outcome. If we failed to guess the correct password after
                       3 tries, Python will still run but we will not get anymore guesses. This is because when this is True, the "while" command is matched and so we get 3 
                       guesses. But since we also have the "if out_of_guesses:" command, Python will be confused and cannot continue => We need to end the run manually. 
                       The second scenario when we get the password correctly. This means the "while" command is no longer true and Python will jump to the "if out_of_guesses" 
                       command (remember we set the "out_of_guesses" to be True from the beginning) and print out "Out of guesses, you lose!".

while guesses != password and out_of_guesses:
    if guesses_count < guesses_limit:
        guesses = input("Enter guess: ")
        guesses_count += 1
    else:
        out_of_guesses = True
if out_of_guesses:
    print("Out of guesses, you lose!")
else:
    print("You win!")
